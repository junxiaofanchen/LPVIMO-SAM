# LPVIMO-SAM Code Release
The code and dataset of the LPVIMO-SAM method will be released as soon as the paper has been accept, and this paper combines five sensors, including lidar/scene polarization vision/IMU/Magnetometer/optical flow ranging module, which is suitable for low-texture, low-feature and feature sparse feature degradation scenarios, and effectively improves the robustness and positioning accuracy of the navigation system. 🚀🚀🚀 Stay tuned for updates and detailed documentation on how to use our method！
