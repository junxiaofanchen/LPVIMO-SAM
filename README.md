# LPVIMO-SAM
The LPVIMO-SAM algorithm will upload the code and dataset after the paper is received, and this paper combines five sensors, including lidar/scene polarization vision/IMU/Magnetometer/optical flow ranging module, which is suitable for low-texture, low-feature and feature sparse feature degradation scenarios, and effectively improves the robustness and positioning accuracy of the navigation system.
